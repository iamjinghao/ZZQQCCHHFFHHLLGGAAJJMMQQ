Chapter 2: To think that he would even bring up the past

Whenever a conflict arose between the two of them, she would never argue. She was always a direct hands-on person about such things.

She would always be on the losing end anyway if there was an argument.

If she could not beat him, then she'd just have to bear with it.

Thus at this moment now, she could only choose to endure it and pass the message to Yan Rusheng before quickly leaving his room.

For the whole morning, Wen Xuxu's mind kept revolving around the images that she saw when she rushed into Young Master Wen's room.

No, she wasn't fantasizing about it. Instead, those images were like a curse as it kept lingering in her mind.

'It's not like you've not seen it before, didn't you even touch it before when we were young? Here, let me take it off and let you play with it?

Fuck, to think that he could even bring up the past. They were young at that time and didn't understand the differences between a man and a woman. Beside at that time, she also...

Having thought about something, Xuxu's face turned rather gloomy at that.

She composed herself and took a deep breath, telling herself: "So after they had grown up, this was the first time that she has seen it.

And after seeing it, she immediately felt very unwell. Just like right now, she was feeling very distracted no matter what she did.

It was already approaching lunch time. Wen Xuxu's cell phone in front of her rang.

She had a look at the caller ID and it showed the number of the president's office.

That bunch of darkness floated across her mind once more and her face flushed red again.

She picked up the phone and placed it to her year, gently calling out, "President."

When Yan Rusheng heard how she answered the phone, he laughed and said, "Are you really Wen Xuxu?"

Wen Xuxu frowned. What did he mean by that? What did he mean by asking if she was really Wen Xuxu?

How could he possibly not recognize her voice since he has been hearing it from young?

This fellow must be doing this on purpose.

"Yes, President." She resumed her normal volume of speaking. 

Yan Rusheng also dropped the friendly tone in his voice and said in a commanding way, "Come in here."

"Yes." Wen Xuxu replied and put down the phone. Then, she stood up with her eyes closed and took a deep breath.

Don't think anymore, hurry up and forget it all.

After that, she knocked on the door and entered Yan Rusheng's office.

"President."

Yan Rusheng was sitting in the luxurious office chair and there was a pile of documents in front of him awaiting his signature. He was looking through them when he heard Wen Xuxu calling out to him.

He looked up and a face that looked like it was carved out by master masons with an uncanny workmanship. Those deep dimensional facial features, especially that unfathomable pair of shrewd looking eyes, was enveloped with a sense of mystery to anyone looking at it.

His white shirt made that handsome face of his look even fairer and cleaner, as the sun shone in through the windows as though it had been bribed by him, and gave him a sparkling presence.

Everything else around him immediately became very indistinct. 

Wen Xuxu walked up to him. She couldn't help but think of what she saw this morning again as her face turned red once more.

She bowed her head slightly to hide the shyness and embarrassment in her eyes with that long eyelashes of hers.

Yan Rusheng looked at her and said, "Ouyang will arrive at the airport at three in the afternoon. Go and pick her up. You know what you have to bring."

When he finished speaking, he lowered his head back down and continue reviewing the documents.

He was getting her to handle his harem again. How annoying.

Although Wen Xuxu was complaining in her heart, she answered very with a very sincere tone, "Understood, President."

Since she started working as Yan Rusheng's secretary, the greatest amount of work she did was to help Yan Rusheng to put in order his "harem". That scoundrel! He really wouldn't be able to change his fickle ways.

To arrive at the airport by 3 PM, Wen Xuxu had to leave by 2 PM. She drove off in the Audi Q7 that the company had assigned to her.

Although it wasn't the rush hour yet, she still managed to get delayed on the ring roads for quite a while.
