Uber Pampered Marriage: Black-bellied Husband, Tsundere Wife!

Chapter 1: What are you acting all shy for?

On the spotless marble flooring, Wen Xuxu's slender figure could be seen reflecting off it. She was holding the latest cell phone model from Rongsheng in each of her hands as she walked hastily towards the president's office with a blue file tucked under her arms.

"Sister Xuxu, why are you in such a hurry?"

In Rongsheng, no one did not know about her being the childhood friend of the big boss, Yan Rusheng. She had attended the same kindergarten, the same primary school, and the same secondary school. She even attended university in B-city with him.***

After her graduation, she had been personally hired by the old chairman into Rongsheng to be the president's secretary, which meant she was Big Boss Yan's secretary.

As such, other than those veterans in leadership roles at the company, everyone else would respectfully address her as Sister Xuxu no matter how young or old they were.

Wen Xuxu smiled at that person who asked her that question and waved the cell phone in her hand. "A call for the president."

As she spoke, she already reached the front of the president's office. She reached her hand out and knocked on the door twice.

Thereafter, she turned the doorknob and pushed it open before going in.

"President Yan."

She didn't see Yan Rusheng around.

The president's office was a two-bedroomed, one-living room suite that was decorated simply with a European flair and was matched with a gray-white furniture series. An ash-gray porcelain desk and a white director's chair sat in front of floor-to-ceiling windows that spanned across the wall. Outside, the view of half the city could be seen.

After calling out to him and getting no response, her gaze swept to the master bedroom door.

Sure enough, the door was open.

"Secretary Wen, are you listening? Have you not found President Yan yet?"

Wen Xuxu was hesitating whether to go into the room to pass the phone to Yan Rusheng.

The phone in her right hand was active in call and the sweet voice of a woman could be heard urging at her with some impatience.

Wen Xuxu frowned as she also answered back impatiently, "I'm getting to him immediately."

Saying that, her footsteps headed towards the master bedroom door.

"President Yan, you have a call. It seems to be very urgent."

Before she could see him, his voice already sounded out. There was no need to knock anymore.

Just as she finished speaking, she had already stepped into the room.

A large nude-colored figure was just stepping out of the bathroom as well.

By nude-colored here...it just meant fully nude.

In a moment of panic, she just stood there looking stunned. Her eyes met with the man as she did not move away for the longest time.

"Am I so good looking?" The magnetic voice of a man seemingly cast a spell on her and sounded full of seductive charm.

Wen Xuxu came back to her senses immediately. Her beautiful face instantly flushed red, almost as though she had a rush of blood to her head.

She quickly turned around with her back facing the man with a well-toned physique (ripped body) and said, "President Yan, there's a call for you. It's from Miss Ouyang. She says it's something urgent that she has to look for you about."

Saying that, she threw the cell phone backwards.

Immediately at the next moment, she heard a "plop". The phone must have hit something and sounded like it had definitely broke.***

When she heard that sound, Wen Xuxu couldn't mention how happy she felt on the inside.

Who told you to pollute my eyes so early in the morning.

"Wen Xuxu, what are you acting all shy for? It's not like you've not seen it before." After getting his entire body looked at by someone of the opposite gender, not only did Boss Yan not exclaim out, he even mocked at Wen Xuxu in a very calm manner. "When we were young, didn't we also bath together? Have you forgotten that already?"

His voice was very nice, especially when it sounded like the way it did now. With a trace of some laughter, it was especially enchanting to hear.

Yan Rusheng has always had the image of a "scoundrel" in Wen Xuxu's impression of him since they were young. He had a venomous tongue and was a black-bellied kinda guy too. And to top that off, he was also very fickle with his heart.
